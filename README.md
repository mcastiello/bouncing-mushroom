# Bouncing Mushroom
As far as you can download and play with this game, don't expect it to be the next big thing.

I developed it in order to get confidence with the Pixi.js library and to use it as a brief tutorial for those who want to learn it as well.

The library itself is included in this repository only to make sure that the game works properly since the first download, I'll probably set up a `packages.json` file in order to make it downloadable through `npm`.

There are nearly no comments in the code of the game, I'm planning to adding them, but the code itself should be quite self explanatory, anyway, if you want to know how it works, don't hesitate to contact me.
